Sharing the undocumented things you can do with GitHub, org-mode, and HTML to make a better README.
#+HTML:</div>
** Why?
The README, is your primary method to portray information about a repository to the reader. GitHub supports using =org-mode= to create a README, but it's implementation using =org-ruby= neither works as claimed nor is complete.

That's where these hacks come in, primarily using HTML, to get around these limitations, as well as to show some additional possibilities and preferences.

** Document Structure
This document covers methods to use org-mode and HTML together. The headings are sorted by the goal we want to achieve, not by the method used to achieve it.
